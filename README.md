# Vanilla Javascript Bomberman - multilevel game.

The original home computer game Bomber Man was released in July 1983 in Japan. This project was built loosely after the original. It's a single player game.

## Objectives
Here are some of the features implemented in the game:

* Game runs at at least 60 FPS
* Use of RequestAnimationFrame
* Pause menu, that includes: continue & restart   
  
* A score board that displays the following metrics:
1. Countdown clock or Timer that indicates the amount of time the player has until the game ends 
2. Score that displays the current score (XP or points)
3. Lives that shows the number of lives that the player has left

## How to play?
